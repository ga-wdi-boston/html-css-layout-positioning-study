# HTML CSS Layout Study

## Prerequisites

-   HTML and CSS

## Reading

One of the best CSS tutorials out there is from a local web development shop,
[bocoup](https://bocoup.com). Their [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com)
tutorial focuses on fundamentals of CSS, something we want to focus on early to
improve our development speed and understanding of CSS for later projects.

The tutorial is made of short sections that focus on one, specific aspect of
layout with CSS. This makes it not only a great tutorial for layout, but also a
valuable reference for later. You'll probably come back to this document from
time to time when you need help with your layout.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Explain the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`
-   Explain the CSS box-model.
-   Explain `clear` and `float`.
