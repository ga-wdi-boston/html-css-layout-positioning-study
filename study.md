What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between
 them.

```md
Box-sizing is a CSS property that makes CSS layouts work intuitively. Using
properties like width, padding, and border can be confusing. Sometimes when you
use the width property, it doesnâ€™t always apply in the way that you might
expect. However, with proper box-sizing, a width of 200px really means a
rendered width of 200px.
```

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute
 positioning.

```md
Absolute positioning allows you to remove an object from the typical flow of
the document and place it at a specific point on the page.
Relative positioning works similarly to absolute positioning in that you can use
top, bottom, left and right to scoot an object to a specific point on the page.
The primary difference is the origin or starting point for the element. The item
placed relative to the startinmg family.
```

What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common
 mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

```md
- Using floats but not clearing them.
- Not understanding how position:absolute; works in the context of other
  positioned elements.
- Omitting semi-colons for each property declaration in a series of
  delcarations.
```
