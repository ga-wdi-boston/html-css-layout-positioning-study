What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between
 them.

```md
border box and content box are the two main options. border box makes the width
a set value and no amount of padding or margin can change that. with content box,
the width and height only affect the content within the element.
```

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute
 positioning.

```md
relative positioning sets the position on an element where it would naturally be
and then you can move it from there.
absolute sets by its nearest ancestor whether that be a child or a parent element.
```

What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common
 mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

```md
1. not using a clearfix
2. not using browser prefixes
3. setting a width rather than a max width
```
