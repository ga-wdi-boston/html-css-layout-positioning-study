## CSS box-sizing

What are the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between them.

```md
'Box-sizing' options in CSS relate to what is included when the width and heigh properties are set:
  border-box: includes content/padding/border, does not include margin
  content-box: includes content, does not include padding/border/margin

## Relative vs Absolute Positioning

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute positioning.

```md
Absolute positioning sets an element in a specific place on a page, this allows us to set the element exactly where we want it and it will not adjust when the browser window is re-sized

Relative positioning allows an element to shift based on its position relative to other factors such as attributes or the re-sizing of the browser window
