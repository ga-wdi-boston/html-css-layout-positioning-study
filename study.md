1. Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com). This should take about 45
minutes to an hour. 1. Submit a pull request with responses to the following
questions:

* What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the
differences between them.

The property box-sizing can be set to content-box (its inital value) or
border-box.  content-box only takes the width and height of the content into
consideration. border-box calculates width/height of the border, padding, and
content when displaying its size.

* In your own words, explain the difference between
relative and absolute positioning.
relative position defaults to static, but you can change its positioning by setting properties.
absolute position will act as a fixed position box in relation to the nearest positioned ancestor or, if none are positioned, the document body.

* What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common
* mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.   * 1. Using float on
* an element, causing it to overlap with another.   * 2. Forgetting to add the
* prefix version of a property to ensure all browsers show the same layout  3.
* Confusing relative and absolute positioning.
