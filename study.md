1. Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com). This should take about 45 minutes to an hour.
1. Submit a pull request with responses to the following questions:
    * What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between them.
    * In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute positioning.
    * What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.


Not sure if this is a trick question but it looks like there are just two options for box-sizing according to the reading and they are simple and fancy. Both are obviously boxes, but fancy allows for a padded border and color options.

Relative stays positioned when scrolled but absolute will move with it while staying exactly where it was positioned on the page before.

Using width instead of max width for small windows. A floating image hanging outside of its container.writing CSS code to work on a browser that doesnt support it.
