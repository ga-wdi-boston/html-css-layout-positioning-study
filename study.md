What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between
 them.

```md
Setting CSS on an element to box-sizing: border-box ensures that the padding and border of that element does not add to the total width.
This can also be used on all elements on a web page to make it a default for all elements.
```

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute
 positioning.

```md
Relative positioning places an element according to settings specified in code, and the element will not automatically move to fill in spaces any spaces or gaps.
Absolute positioning sets the position of an element within the element of the nearest parent or ancestor.
```

What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common
 mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

```md
Three mistakes that are commonly made:  An image within an element goes beyond the size of the element when it is floated.  CSS default properties are not taken into account or removed, and these settings can cause designs to be misaligned.  A third common mistake is the failure to take into account different screen sizes which can result in poor page layouts in certain situations, like using a cellphone or iPad.
