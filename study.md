1. Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com). This should take about 45 minutes to an hour.
1. Submit a pull request with responses to the following questions:

    * What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between them.

- without the box-sizing the margin, padding and border impact the size of the object/thing that it gets applied to
- with the new function 'box-sizing' you can prevent that
- it's easier and more intuitive


    * In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute positioning.

    Relative positioning:

    Object appears relative to its normal position, with css you can change its position, that will always be relative to wher it would apprear without any css. Reference to the whole website.

    Absolute Positioning:

    It works like relative but it takes as the reference the nearest object/thing it belongs to instead of the whole webpage.


    * What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

- using width: 600px; instead of max-width so that you site can be responsive
- forgetting that margin actually adds pixel to your object and that padding shrinks your object in order to add padding
- having too many classes and id's so that you get confused and don't know why something won't set it to what you want
- not having a clear idea before you start working on the css on how your design should look like in the end
