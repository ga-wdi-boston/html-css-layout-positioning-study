What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between
 them.

```md
<!--There is box-sizing and border-box, which stops the width and border elements from increasing. You can set these specifically per browser as well using moz-box-siziing or webkit-box-sizing along with border-box. -->
```

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute
 positioning.

```md
<!--Relative positioning is very similar to static positioning only it allows for some elements to be set to it. And absolute positioning is virtually the same as fixed posiitoning except it will either scroll next to a positioned ancestor of it, or the document body if there are no ancestors.-->
```

What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common
 mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

```md
<!-- Using to many divs, IDs instead of class elements to classify different parts of the page, and floating incorrectly. -->
```
