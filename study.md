What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between
 them.

```md
Height + Width: defining the bounds of the box like you would with a ruler and a pencil.
Padding: Adds to the already present dimensions from the box and expands outwards.
Border: technically you could assign a 100px width border with an empty <div> and it would behave accordingly
```

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute
 positioning.

```md
Relative postioning means that it's postioned relatively to the bounds of the browser. Absolute means it postion "absolutely" with in it's nearest parent element that also has a postion value.
```

What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common
 mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

```md
Absolute and relative positioning. Floats and clears. z-inex. Defining fixed margins that will knock elements out of order.
```
