width/height exactly what it sounds like.


padding is like a border immediately around an element or the content. The padding betweeen an element and its border

border is a styled border around an element, with padding in between it and the element and a margin on the outside of that.

margin is the outermost part of the box model. Just like the margins on the furthestmost edge of line paper in a notebook.

From inside out:
content/element=>padding=>border=>margin

box-sizing: when you set this to an element, padding and border no longer add to it's width and height. Meaning it is just content, and it's margins.

  an absolutely positioned piece of content is anything but static. If it ha sno positioned ancestors

    * What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.
