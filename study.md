Submit a pull request with responses to the following questions

What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between
 them.

```md
I only learned of one which is to set the box-sizing to border-box. That
makes the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width.
```

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute
 positioning.

```md
relative positioning can have its properties moved around where as absolute
positoning is fixed.
```

What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common
 mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

```md
I would say:
Forgetting to use the right terms for your tags. Like for example, "color" and
"background-color" are two different things

Positioning is another huge one, one wrong text can have the layout look like a
mess.

And finally, not confusing the different tags you have and what properties you
add to them
```
