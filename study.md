<!-- You can manually set the width with a PX count
or do a % of the total.  The benifit of the % is that
it will help size things to avaliable space, teh downside is if
you have content that needs to be over a minimum size to lookgood a
% assignment may let the content go under the minimum space

## Relative vs Absolute Positioning

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute positioning.

```md
<!-- Relative positioning stays locked where you put it on the
page, regardless of where the user moves around.  So if I make
a box with an image of a cat, and position it as relative, the user
can scroll away from the image.  If I made the same image fixed
the user could never get away from teh kitty.  Absolute is like
fixed except that fixed locks content to the entire broweser
window.  Absolute will lock content to either the entire browser
or let you lock content withing a relative space.
