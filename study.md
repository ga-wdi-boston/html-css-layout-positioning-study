What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between
 them.

```md
You can use the basic box model where you can adjusting the size of the content, padding, border, and margin.  There is also something called box-sizing: border-box, which is apparently much easier.  From what I can understand, it renders the actual width you make it where as using the box model tends to give you something different.

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute
 positioning.

```md
Relative positioning is giving the ability to move an element from the position it would normally be, by adding positioning attributes such as: top, left, bottom, or right.

Absolute positioning is giving the ability to essentially place an element exactly where you want it. Again, you use the positioning attributes: top, left, bottom, or right.
