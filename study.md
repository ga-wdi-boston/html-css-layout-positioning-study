1. Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com). This should take about 45 minutes to an hour.
1. Submit a pull request with responses to the following questions:
    * What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between them.

    padding: adds space between the box border and the content
    border: adds a visible border to the box
    margin: adds space between the box border and the content surrounding it

    * In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute positioning.

    Relative positioned elements stay in the default position unless you add extra properties,
    allowing you to change its position. Absolutely positioned elements remain fixed no matter what, but relative to the closest positioned element instead of being fixed in the viewport.

    * What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

    Using too many divs, using ID's instead of class tags, inline styles.
