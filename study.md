Instructions
------------

1. Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com). This should take about 45 minutes to an hour.
1. Submit a pull request with responses to the following questions:
    * What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between them.
    * box-sizing: border-box and writing a smaller width value. box-sizing is more intuitive
    * in that it relates padding and border to your elements and smaller width is extra math
    * and does not span the whole element set or document.

    * In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute positioning.
    Relative positioning relates to the screen and is positioned with the document or
    screen's parameters while the parameters of absolute are based on another element.
    top: 200px in relative is from the top of the page while 200px absolute is from
    another element, like a relatively positioned div.

    * What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.
    No room for a fixed element. Trying to float text smaller than the image it's
    supposed to wrap 'round.
