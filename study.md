1. Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com). This should take about 45 minutes to an hour.
1. Submit a pull request with responses to the following questions:
    * What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between them.
    * In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute positioning.
    * What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

You can size boxes with absolute pixel dimensions, by percentage of dimensions of the element it occupies,
or by the new flex-box standards which define a default display dimension, a minimum display dimension,
and and fraction of the remaining room in the element.

Relative positioning will adjust an elements position based on the difference from it's default position.
Absolute positioning will place it in a location according to it's parent element.

Common mistakes are having elements overflow their parent elements, resizing cutting off the display of some
content, and having an element being an unexpected size due to margin/border/passing differences.
